## 🧠 What is a Trainer in Dying Light?

A **trainer** is a standalone app or script that hooks into the Dying Light process and gives you hotkey-activated power-ups in real time. No need for glitching, modding files, or grinding for 50 hours. Just run the trainer, launch the game, and press a key to dominate.

## 🔥 Real Player Feedback

> “Used a trainer to max all skill trees after starting NG+. Best decision ever!” – *InfectedHunter*

## 🛡️ Is It Safe?

Yes — as long as you’re using it in **single-player**. Trainers are for solo fun, not for online PvP (which Dying Light doesn’t even have in a competitive sense). Still, avoid using them in co-op mode if you wanna stay chill with your squad.

Also: **Backup your save** just in case. Trainers can do a lot, and you don’t wanna break your main file.

## 🚫 What to Avoid

* ❌ Don’t use online if devs add anti-cheat updates
* ❌ Don’t activate every cheat at once (can crash your session)
* ❌ Don’t use trainers from shady unknown sources (you know the ones)
